# Lost & Found App
## CSE3311 Project

- Project Vision
 -Our group, Group-7, has developed a concept for a university-specific lost and found app. Similar to Craigslist, this app aims to provide an easy and convenient way for students to locate their lost items. 

- Goals

  - University-based lost and found tool.
  - Craigslist, but for lost things so people can find their things.
  - Location of lost item, picture of item, & time lost is required.
  - Chat room capabilities

- Features

  - Sign Up & Verify users attend the college in question
  - Account Settings
  - Creat a Lost Item Report
    - Items details, Possible Location(s) Lost, Time, and Picture (if have) go into report for searching purposes
    - Show Results for possible items
  - Create a Found Item Report
    - Items details, Location Found, Time, and Picture go into report for searching purposes
    - Show Claims for an item & Possible Claims
  - Refine Results for Results Screen by the basis of location, time, & item description
  - Open Chat Room to coordinate 
  - Have Report System to help 
  - Have Rating System for Trustworthiness

- Risks

  - Stopping people from cheating the system
    - Using School SSO to maintain identification/integrity
    - Not showing lost items publicly w/o proper find requirements
    - An abuse checking system analyzing user patterns
  - Our team members are unfamiliar with the frameworks we're going to use
  - Figuring out UTA's SSO issue.
